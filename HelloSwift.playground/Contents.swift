# Swift Crash Course
*A fast paced intro to Swift*

## Hello Swift

Swift is a language that Apple has been working on for years. All the changes to Objective C over the last few years have been with Swift in mind.

Swift is similar to C and Objective C, but there is no need for sperate header and implementation files.

Swift was designed to make code safer and clearer in intent. It is a type safe language, meaning if something in your code is expecting a string, you cannot pass it an int.

Swift uses type inference, so if you decalre a var and don't set it's type implicitly it will infer the type if there is enough information.

var age = 11
//var temperament = nil
//var friendliness:String = nil
var helpfulness:String? = nil

## Xcode

You will need Xcode 7 or later in order to use Swift 2.0 which is what we will be using in this course.

You can download Xcode from here

[Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)

The latest version at the time I'm writing this is 7.0.1.
A beta verion 7.1 beta 2 is available as well.

## Playgrounds

Playgrounds are awesome. You are looking at a playground right now. With playgrounds you can run code and see the output without the need to create and compile a full app.

Playgrounds are great learning tools as you can add markdown like what you are reading right now and combine it with code that runs and shows you the output like below.

We will be using Playgrounds extensively in this course.
